4 - Tasks:

For this specific moment, with the upcoming launch in the next 2 months of important parts of our products like Firolauss and the token of our ecosystem $NEROX, we will need a task force from our ambassadors.

Create At Least 3 Original Weekly Contents About Neurolanche:

Ambassadors are expected to produce a minimum of three original pieces of content per week on their official profiles. This can include articles, posts, videos, or any other creative content related to Neurolanche.

Establish Regionalized Neurolanche Profiles:

Participate in Biweekly Ambassador Meetings:

Participate in Biweekly Ambassador Meetings:

Ambassadors are required to actively participate in biweekly ambassador meetings. These meetings will serve as a platform to discuss strategies, updates, and address any questions or concerns from the ambassador community.


Engage and Moderate Neurolanche Community Channels:

Ambassadors will be responsible for actively engaging with the Neurolanche community on various channels, such as Discord, Telegram, or other community platforms. This includes moderating discussions, answering queries, and fostering a positive community environment.


Organize Local Meetups or Virtual Events:

Encourage ambassadors to organize local meetups or virtual events to connect with the Neurolanche community in their respective regions. This could be in the form of webinars, Q&A sessions, or casual gatherings to enhance community bonding.


Feedback Loop:

Ambassadors should establish a feedback loop between the community and the Neurolanche team. Gathering insights, suggestions, and concerns from the community and presenting them during ambassador meetings for constructive discussions.
Educational Initiatives:

Educational Initiatives:

Create and share educational content about Neurolanche, including tutorials, guides, and explanations about the ecosystem's features. This will contribute to better understanding and awareness among community members.

Bug Reporting and Improvement Suggestions:

Encourage ambassadors to actively participate in testing and report any bugs or issues they encounter. Additionally, gather suggestions for improvements from the community and share them with the development team.

Business Development Outreach:

Ambassadors can actively contribute to the business development aspect by reaching out to potential partners, influencers, and collaborators. Establishing meaningful connections with other projects, communities, and industry leaders can open up opportunities for partnerships and collaborations that benefit Neurolanche.


Identifying Integration Opportunities:

Keep an eye on potential integration opportunities with other blockchain projects, gaming platforms, or emerging technologies. Identifying areas where Neurolanche can integrate or collaborate seamlessly can enhance its ecosystem and bring in new user bases.

4.1 - Ambassador Task Validation Process:

On a monthly basis, ambassadors will be required to submit a comprehensive report through the Neurolanche Github platform. In these reports, ambassadors will compile a detailed account of their activities and contributions to the Neurolanche community, showcasing their efforts in promoting and expanding the project. The Neurolanche Core Team will conduct a thorough analysis of these reports, evaluating the impact, creativity, and consistency of the ambassadors' work. Based on this assessment, monthly rewards will be allocated to ambassadors, creating a performance-based incentive structure that encourages sustained commitment and meaningful contributions.

4.2 - Reward Structure and Budget Allocation:

Head Ambassadors will operate within a total max budget of 4000 ASTR monthly, accompanied by additional incentives in the form of NEROX Airdrop. This budget is designed to recognize and reward the dedication and effectiveness of Head Ambassadors in driving the Neurolanche Ambassador Program's success. The allocation ensures that ambassadors are not only acknowledged for their ongoing efforts but also incentivizes them to continue elevating the Neurolanche community and ecosystem. The transparent reward system fosters a collaborative environment, aligning the interests of the ambassadors with the overarching goals of Neurolanche.

Looking ahead, Neurolanche envisions a transition to a reward system primarily denominated in $NEROX tokens. As the project progresses and the $NEROX ecosystem gains prominence, our goal is to align ambassador rewards more closely with the native token. This strategic shift not only fosters a more cohesive and interconnected Neurolanche community but also ensures that ambassadors directly benefit from the success and growth of the $NEROX token. By introducing $NEROX as the primary reward mechanism in the future, we aim to create a symbiotic relationship between ambassadors and the Neurolanche ecosystem, solidifying their role as integral contributors to the project's flourishing journey.
